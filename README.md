This Mod introduces 2 spells for your avatar and origin characters. This spell allows you to add the targeted character to your party. If you cast it on a character already in your party. If you want to re-recruit a character, you can simply remove them in your camp

The spells ignores party limit, but if you  won't be able to recruit characters the legitimate way if you  already have too much characters.

You can freely access the inventories of traders added to your party or trade with them as usual, except when transitioning between acts.

## HOW TO USE :

### The Add Or Remove Spell:
Just target any NPC and it will add or remove them from your party. read related warnings 
It's Safe to use on clone and probably on characters already recruited the legit way

### The Make Clone Or Custom Spell:

The Clone Race is designed to be used with the Clone Spell(Hex Hearth icon). It's essentially a vessel race with no specific traits, tags, flags, etc. When you use the clone spell on an NPC, it triggers character creation.

You can select the clone race to make a clone of the targeted npc, choose the desired class, and proceed. There's no need to personalize the guardian or the clone since it's not gonna be visible.

Or you choose any other race and make your own custom Character, The guardian isn't important you don't have to personalize it.

## WARNING:

### The Add Or Remove Spell:
If you recruit an Essential NPC directly instead of cloning it, it can potentially break the game. Therefore, it's at your own risk, and i don't recommend doing that. 

Many NPCs aren't intended to be played by the player, so some may lack certain actions like jumping or crouching, and some might trigger events when they shouldn't. Cloning an Npc instead of recruiting it directly prevent all of that.

Clone are better and safer to use than directly recruiting NPC throught this spell, but you won't inherit the targeted NPC's inventory 

### The Make Clone Or Custom Spell:

The Clone Spell(Hex Hearth icon) should be a lot safer than the add/remove(Friends Icon) 

After Creation Clone will Have your main character XP + 1 lvl

You can't Clone a Clone you can only clone from the source character, im working on a mod to spawn specifics NPC clone so you won't have to find them by yourself

you can Long Rest without having to dismiss every NPC you've recruited.

## REQUIRED:
bg3 script extender (you can install it directly from the bg3 mod manager by clicking Tools -> Download & Extract Script extender).

## INSTALLATION:
I recommend using bg3 mod manager.
