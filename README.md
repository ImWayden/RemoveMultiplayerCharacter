# RemoveMultiplayerCharacter
BG3 Mod, To add any NPC to your party 

The goal was to be able to remove Multiplayer Character from party 

and being able to rerecruit them, but turns out i was more fun to 

be able to recruit any NPC in the game

##To DO

ADD "PLAYABLE" Tag to recuited character so they'll be resurrectable

Or Modify resurrection spell so it can revive anyone not only PLAYABLE character

need to find a good condition to send character to camp when they are dissmissed, can't send everyone that is dismissed 

perhaps adding a perma dismiss or a send to camp spell
